Add NEW JUnit tests to verify and fix the bugs that currently exist 
in the ContainerArray class.  The existing tests should continue to 
pass as you make changes.

The point of this lab is not to stress your debugging skills but to 
practice TDD, so how you fix the bugs is entirely up to you but fix 
them ONE at a time, using the TDD process.
