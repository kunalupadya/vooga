We talked about refactoring to make the longest methods much shorter. Currently there are two methods that are about 200 lines, and these will be refactored in the future. These methods will undergo significant change in the future, so in order to not have to rewrite the methods in the future we will push off this refactoring until a later date. Today, we went through and added TODOS on all the empty methods in our code base, to fix some of the issues noted by the design.cs.edu website. We also refactored methods in active wave and level, which had too many nested control statements by moving the control statements into separate methods to remove the nesting control statements
