Backend Team notes:
Slightly modifying hierarchies to include selectively implementable interfaces
Ensuring that the interfaces module is accessible to authoring environment 
Design: need to determine how to save images into grid for user-defined grid spaces

at runtime, passing in list of viewables, pass viewables as terrain viewables
ToDo: Get cracking on game logic, be able to assign stuff to begin coding game logic


Frontend Team notes:
Authoring environment: should be reading the parameters that should be input by the user when creating new things
