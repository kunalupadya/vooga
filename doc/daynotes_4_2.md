Backend Team notes:
Slightly modifying hierarchies to include selectively implementable interfaces
Ensuring that the interfaces module is accessible to authoring environment 

ToDo: Get cracking on game logic, be able to assign stuff to begin coding game logic

Frontend Team notes:
Authoring environment: should be reading the parameters that should be input by the user when creating new things
